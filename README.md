Generate Schema.org structured data via shortcode. Supports HowTo, FAQPage, ItemList, CreativeWork.

== Description ==

Schema Structured Data helps you add valid Schema.org markup to your WordPress content. This improves how search engines understand your content and **may qualify for Google Rich Snippets** (depending on schema type and page structure).

= Supported Schema Types =

* **HowTo** — Step-by-step tutorials (Google Rich Result eligible, 1 per page recommended)
* **FAQPage** — Questions & Answers (Google Rich Result eligible, 1 per page limit enforced)
* **ItemList** — Ordered/unordered lists (Google Rich Result eligible)
* **CreativeWork** — General content (SEO only, no Rich Result)

= Important: Google Rich Results =

Not all schema types guarantee Rich Snippets. Google has specific requirements:

* **HowTo:** Best results with ONE main tutorial per page
* **FAQPage:** Only ONE FAQPage schema per page is eligible for Rich Results (plugin enforces this)
* **ItemList:** Works well for top-10 lists, product collections
* **CreativeWork:** Helps SEO but does not trigger Rich Results

This plugin generates **valid Schema.org markup**. Rich Result eligibility depends on your content structure and Google's algorithms.

== Usage ==

= HowTo Schema =

`
[schema type="HowTo" name="How to Draw a Rune" time="5M"]
Step 1: Clear your mind
Step 2: Focus on your question
Step 3: Click the daisy
[/schema]
`

= FAQPage Schema =

Use `|` to separate questions and answers (one Q&A per line):

`
[schema type="FAQPage" name="Rune FAQ"]
What are runes? | Ancient Germanic alphabet symbols
How do I use them? | Focus on a question and draw randomly
When should I draw? | When you need guidance
[/schema]
`

For schema-only output (no visible HTML), add `hidden="1"`:

`
[schema type="FAQPage" name="FAQ" hidden="1"]
Question 1 | Answer 1
Question 2 | Answer 2
[/schema]
`

= ItemList Schema =

`
[schema type="ItemList" name="Top 3 Runes"]
Fehu - Wealth and abundance
Uruz - Strength and vitality
Thurisaz - Protection and power
[/schema]
`

For unordered list (bullets), add `items-tag="ul"`:

`
[schema type="ItemList" name="My List" items-tag="ul"]
Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
[/schema]
`

= CreativeWork Schema =

`
[schema type="CreativeWork" name="My Guide" description="A comprehensive rune guide"]
Your content here...
[/schema]
`

= Attributes =

* `type` — Schema type: HowTo, FAQPage, ItemList, CreativeWork (default: HowTo)
* `name` — Title of the schema (required for all types)
* `description` — Brief description (HowTo, CreativeWork)
* `time` — Duration (HowTo only, auto-converts to ISO 8601: "5M", "1H30M", "PT30M")
* `image` — Featured image URL (HowTo only)
* `hidden` — Hide HTML output, keep schema only (values: 1, true)
* `position` — Starting position for ItemList numbering (ItemList only)
* `url` — URL for list items (ItemList only, applies to all items)
* `items-tag` — HTML tag for ItemList: "ol" (default) or "ul"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will I get a Google Rich Snippet? =

Schema markup **may** qualify for Rich Snippets, but Google has specific requirements:

* **HowTo:** Use ONE per page for best results
* **FAQPage:** Only ONE per page is eligible (plugin enforces this limit)
* **ItemList:** Works well for ranked lists
* **CreativeWork:** SEO benefit only, no Rich Result

Valid schema improves how Google understands your content, but Rich Results depend on content quality, page structure, and Google's algorithms.

= Can I use multiple shortcodes on one page? =

Yes, but with limitations:

* **HowTo:** Multiple allowed, but Google may only show one as Rich Result
* **FAQPage:** Only the FIRST one is processed (Google limit enforced by plugin)
* **ItemList:** Multiple allowed
* **CreativeWork:** Multiple allowed

= How do I verify the schema is working? =

1. Publish your page
2. Visit [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
3. Enter your page URL
4. Check for detected schema types

For syntax validation, use [Schema Validator](https://validator.schema.org/).

= Why does FAQPage only work once per page? =

Google explicitly states that only **one FAQPage schema per page** is eligible for Rich Results. This plugin enforces that limit to prevent invalid markup and improve your chances of getting a Rich Result.

= What is the Q|A format for FAQPage? =

Each line should contain a question and answer separated by a pipe character (`|`):

`
Question 1 | Answer 1
Question 2 | Answer 2
Question 3 | Answer 3
`

The plugin automatically parses this format and generates proper FAQ schema markup.

= Can I hide the HTML output but keep the schema? =

Yes! Add `hidden="1"` to any shortcode:

`
[schema type="FAQPage" name="FAQ" hidden="1"]
Question | Answer
[/schema]
`

This outputs the JSON-LD schema without visible HTML on the page.

== Screenshots ==

1. Shortcode in Editor — Add [schema] to any post or page
2. Frontend Output — Clean HTML with proper Q&A formatting for FAQPage
3. JSON-LD in Source — Valid Schema.org markup in footer
4. Google Rich Results — Validation passed
